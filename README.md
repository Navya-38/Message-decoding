# 📩 Binary Message Decoder

This project implements a Binary Message Decoder using Python and Tkinter.
It decodes binary-encoded messages based on a given header and displays the output in a simple GUI.


## 🚀 Features

- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
- Accepts a header and binary message as input
- Implements a custom decoding algorithm using key mapping
- Decodes the message using a key-generation and mapping algorithm.


## ⚙️ How It Works  
-  The user enters a **header** and a **binary message**.
-  The program generates binary keys and maps them to characters using the header.  
- The binary message is segmented and decoded according to this mapping.  
- The final decoded message is displayed in the GUI.  

  
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
